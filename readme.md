# All Spell Wands

Allows all spell types to spawn on wands.

This was an experiment after playing with Normalized Probabilities, since most spells come on wands, and base wands only really spawn projectiles, modifiers, and draw. I've found it it be kind of OP in a boring way where you get almost everything you need and shops are useless. But it's still handy for checking out spell probability mods, if you want to try out some of the less common spells, or just get OP pretty fast while still having some random generation.

**CAUTION**: enemies can cast wands too.

Does not currently override the special floor 1 wands.
